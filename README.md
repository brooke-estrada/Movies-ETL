# Movies-ETL Project

### Overview of the Project
We extracted two datasets from Wikipedia and the Movie Database website. We retrieved datasets that included movies between 1990 and 2018, 20 million reviews and, a metadata file with details about the movies.  We then transformed and merged the datasets into one clean data set. And finally, we loaded the data set into a SQL database. 

### Purpose
The Amazing Prime video team is creating an algorithm to predict which low-budget films will become popular so the company can purchase the streaming rights. To accomplish this task, the team has decided to host a Hack-a-hon where participants will predict the most popular movies. One of the team members, Britta, has asked our team to help create a clean data set for the participants to use.
